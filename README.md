It’s designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:
- When do they want to wake up?
- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed.

## Key points
- Form
- Stepper
- DatePicker
- Working with date
- Traning a model with Create ML

## Challenges
- Use section
- Use picker instead of stepper
- Always show the bed time result on the screen
